            We stand behind every brand we carry. For years, it’s the only way we’ve known how to do business.
            Our company started as a Caterpillar client. At the time, Monark International, which Onofre B. Banson founded in 1962, utilized Caterpillar machines in its forest operations. Monark International will form the core of what is soon to be known as the Monark Group of Companies. Throughout the years, the company would be guided by Mr. Banson’s legacy of a passion for growth, leadership and service, which form the core components of the Monark corporate vision.

            As a respected leader in the Construction industry, Mr. Banson expanded Monark’s business by venturing into major infrastructure projects and partnering with both the government and private sectors. Most notable and prestigious of these projects were the Angat Dam, U.S. Sangley Airbase, Voice of America, Island Cement, Continental Cement, Northern Cement, Hi Cement, Sheraton Hotel and Makati Medical Center in the 1960’s, and the Marinduque Mines/Nonoc Project, Acoje Mines/AG&P Project, Makati Stock Exchange and Development Bank of the Philippines in the 1970’s.

            Projects that followed were the North Luzon Expressway, the Semirara Coal Mine Project, the Quezon and Sual Power Plants, and the Malampaya Concrete Gravity Structure.

            1987 marked yet another milestone in the history of the Monark Group of Companies when the sons of Onofre—Jan-B and Louie—made a successful bid for the CAT dealership. Thus was born Monark Equipment.

            In April 1992, with the appointment of Propmech Corporation as its authorized dealer for Caterpillar marine engines and provider of parts and after-sales service, Monark Equipment enabled its dealership network to service the needs of the Marine industry. As it eventually catered to a wider base of industry sectors, Monark Equipment’s product portolio grew and consequently included other leading North American and European heavy equipment brands:
